**SIO BUG** is hosting a transcriptomics meeting this **Thursday, May 4th from 12-3pm in Hubbs 4500**. 

John McCrow (JCVI, microbial and environmental genomics) will present an introduction to transcriptomics covering how & why of using transcriptomics as a tool - showing examples of the breadth and depth of its applications, and covering the all-important considerations about designing RNA-Seq experiments, addressing caveats and current challenges. Lisa Komoroske (NOAA, ecophysiology and genomics of aquatic animals) will also be in attendance.

We will additionally have a discussion with anyone present (all levels- students, postocs,staff, and PIs- welcome!) about what their interests/plans are, where folks are at in the process, and individual and community needs.  A 2 day hands-on workshop will be held in late summer on transcriptomics as well.
