**Dr. Hao Ye (SIO)** will be presenting: 

**"Open Science: Challenges and Opportunities for Research in the Digital Age"**

Isaac Newton famously said “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” The Open Science movement is the modern re-embodiment of this philosophy, harnessing the Internet and technology to increase Accessibility, Reproducibility, and Transparency in the scientific enterprise. While some aspects (e.g. data- and code-sharing requirements) pose additional burdens, open science also represents an opportunity to broaden research impacts and accelerate the democratization of science. In this talk, I discuss 4 major components of the movement: (1) motivating drivers (e.g. the “replication crisis” in psychology and biomedical science, calls for more accountability in publicly-funded research); (2) current trends in scientific publishing (e.g. open access and Sci-Hub); (3) mandates from funding agencies (e.g. NSF, NIH, the Gates Foundation); and (4) technology and infrastructure (e.g. GitHub, data repositories, the Open Science Framework, PLOS). I conclude with an overview of the resources and actions that are available to empower scientific practices for individual researchers, and the potential for institutional leadership in guiding the future direction of scientific research.
