SIO's *Intro to Transcriptomic Workshop* was incredibly informative and a lot of fun- a great group of participants and excellent instruction. If you weren't able to attend, you can still catch one of our instructors tomorrow, as **Lisa Komoroske will give the Marine Biology Noon Seminar in Hubbs 4500**.

We also would like to inform the community that the RNASeq analysis materials are up and available for all! A lot of great resources and tutorials were created through this workshop that you should check out:

1) [The Workshop Website](http://rnaseq-workshop-2017.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will stay up, hosted on the ODS github. This includes links to the:
- hands-on tutorials
- hackMD collaborative notes from the two days
- presentation slides

2) Jetstream cloud compute access: we would like to make the rest of our grant allocation available beyond SIO-BUG events to new researchers (student or otherwise) who are in need of more compute power to perform analyses.  This will eventually run out, but please do contact me (Jessica; jmblanton at ucsd dot edu) to discuss whether we can help you out.

A huge thank you for participating, and see you one of the upcoming SIO-BUG events!
