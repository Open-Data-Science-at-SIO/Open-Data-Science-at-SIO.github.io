Hi all,

For Spring quarter, I'll be leading a seminar/journal club on data analysis and reproducible research. Please note that this is NOT an official SIO class and participants will NOT receive course credit. Regardless, I believe it will be a valuable and worthwhile experience.

**Objectives**

(1) Learn and implement practices in research computing including: data management, version control, code documentation, and replicability. (see Wilson et al. "Good enough practices in scientific computing" https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00037)
(2) Reproduce figures and results from published work: test-drive the skills in objective (1) while going in-depth into the methodology of research that piques your interest.

**Target Audience**

Graduate students in the MB and BO programs who are in years 3+. In other words, those with some experience in programming and statistics and now thinking about analyzing data for their dissertations.

Everyone else is welcome to join, but class space is limited, so I will give preference to those in the aforementioned group.

**Logistics**

April 4 - June 6  
(main class) Tuesdays, 3pm - 5pm, Vaughan Hall 328  
(lab/office hours) Fridays, 3pm - 5pm, Vaughan Hall 328

**Syllabus**

**How do I sign up?**

If this sounds like something you're interested in, send me an e-mail with your affiliation (e.g. BO, \#th year). If you already have some ideas for papers you'd like to reproduce results from, please include it with your message.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact me.

Best,
