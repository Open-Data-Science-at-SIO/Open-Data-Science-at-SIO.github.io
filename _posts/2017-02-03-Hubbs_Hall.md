Hi,

We just got news that Hubbs 4500 will be back in service on Wednesday, so the next meeting of the Bioinformatics Users Group as well as future meetings of the [Intro Data Viz](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-Data-Viz-Winter-2017) class will be back to the normally scheduled location.

Happy Friday!
