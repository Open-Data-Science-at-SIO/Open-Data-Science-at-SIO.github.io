Hi,

This quarter, the SIO R Users Group is doing something a little bit different and offering an informal "course" in data visualization and data wrangling.

If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, please check out the course repo at https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-Data-Viz-Winter-2017

and be sure to subscribe to our mailing list for further updates: https://siomail.ucsd.edu/mailman/listinfo/r-users

Best,

== FAQ ==

- Is there a syllabus?
* Yes! If you go to the URL for the course repo, and scroll down, the README will have more details.

- When is this going to happen?
* Thursdays (starting January 12), 1:00 - 2:30pm in Hubbs 4500, though only the first half of that time will be instructional content, with interactive lab for the second half.

- Do I have to attend each week?
* Nope, feel free to show up when you like, though note that we will build on the content from prior weeks (which will be uploaded to the course repo - URL above)

- Who is/are the instructor(s)?
* Some combination of me, Lynn Waterhouse, and Brian Stock.

- How much R do I need to know to take this course?
* Not that much! If you've done programming before or used R sometime in the distant past, we recommend a very brief refresher (https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r), but otherwise you're good to go.

- What if I don't have any programming experience?
* Stay tuned, because Eric Archer is offering an Intro to R "never done any programming at all before" SIO 278 in Spring quarter. Since the materials for our data viz course will be online, you can come back to it after Spring quarter. (again, don't forget to bookmark the course repo - URL above)

- What if I'm already an expert in R / data viz / data wrangling?
* Please let me know which weeks you'd like to guest-teach. :)
