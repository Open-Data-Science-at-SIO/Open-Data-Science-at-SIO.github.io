Hi,

With the recent news about a leak causing water damage in Hubbs 4500, future meetings of the [Intro Data Viz](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/Intro-Data-Viz-Winter-2017) class will be in MESOM 251 until further notice.

This is expected to affect the upcoming meeting of the Bioinformatics User Group as well, so stay tuned for further info on the location.
