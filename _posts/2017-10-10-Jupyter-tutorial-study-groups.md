Hello BUG community,

Thanks for attending our first monthly seminar yesterday. If you missed our shot intro to “Jupyter Notebooks for Data Science”, you can check out the content here: [static version](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/BUG-Resources/blob/master/tutorials/jupyter_ods_2017-10-09.ipynb). For a dynamic version, like the one shown in the presentation, it’s required to install anaconda in your machine/server (installation instructions are found inside the static version). There you are also going to find links to more tutorials and books.

If you need some help to start exploring Jupyter/Bioinformatics and/or work on a project you’re struggling with, you’re not alone!!! There are at least 3 awesome meet up groups for bioinformatics few miles away from you:

A) Starting next week, **Tuesday, October 17th**, our **BUG SIO biweekly meetings will be in Eckart from 1pm-3pm, room TBD**.

B) **Every Friday at Sanford Consortium** (≈10/10h30am) the **Yeo Lab host a Coding Hours session**. For more information about time and room [sing-up for their mail list here](https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/bioinformatics-coding-hours/rd1e4cOXED0/join). When you get the weekly email invitation you should please RSVP and indicate what you plan to work on, so other people can easily spot common topics.

C) **Every Saturday at Geisel, noon-3pm**, there is a **Bioinformatics Study Group**, check out [more info here](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Bioinformatics-SanDiego/events/244036792/).

Last but not least, you can always ask questions in this mailing list!

Wish you all a great week. Hope to see you at the transcriptomics workshop tomorrow.

Best,
Tiago.
