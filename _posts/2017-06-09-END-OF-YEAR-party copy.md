Dear all,

Next week is our end of year party, **Wednesday, June 14**, Surfside.
**Start time 4:30pm**
**End time when the cows come home**

There will be food and drink to be sure. If you have specific requests on that front for you, your family, and friends, do let us know by Monday. Feel free to forward and invite others who may be interested.

In addition to spending some good time together, we have much to celebrate and reflect on from the last few years- from the inception of the SIO-BUG inception to the unifying of interest and efforts with the long running R-Users group under SIO Open Data (see https://open-data-science-at-sio.github.io/).

SIO-BUG also has its first logo, submitted by Du Niu, and which narrowly beat out one of the revised Scripps Genome Center. A high-resolution PDF is [linked](https://open-data-science-at-sio.github.io/images/SIO_BUG_2017.pdf), and we hope the stickers we ordered for it arrive by Wednesday!

See you next week!
