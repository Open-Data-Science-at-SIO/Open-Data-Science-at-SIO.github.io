Hello SIO-BUG Community,

Next week we will welcome back our monthly seminar series! 

Please join us **Monday, March 20th at 12 PM** when we will hear from **Dr. Richard Scheuermann, Director of Informatics at JCVI**, who will be sharing with us on the "**Application of machine learning to determine the cell type diversity of the human neocortex**". 

We will be moving slightly farther up the hill from our usual spot and meeting in the **Munk Conference Room 303**. 

_Pizza and coffee_ will be provided!!! Please bring your mug if you can.

Please also save the dates for our remaining two seminars of the academic year: April 17th when we will hear from Dr. Jeff Bowman and May 8th when we will hear from Dr. Amro Hamdoun. 

Hope to see many of you next week!

Best,
Lauren and Tiago.
