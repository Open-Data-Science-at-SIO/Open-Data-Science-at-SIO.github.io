This fall, SIO-BUG will host a workshop to introduce the basics of transcriptomics with RNAseq!

 Transcriptomics is of increasing use for gene discovery, gene activity investigation, SNP detection, simple sequence repeat discovery, and gene pathway description. This event is intended to share knowledge and expand the skills of our community, particularly among researchers of non-model organisms and microbial communities. 

[**RSVP for the workshop**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb11-Dy_90jnBAnoe5K8-FVXTjxEcCql9w2ipTOG9_xWCsqA/viewform?usp=send_form)

(While the workshop registration is full, we highly recommend you registering anyways, as most folk end up getting off the waitlist!)

**Dates:**
October 11-12, all day with break for lunch

**Location**: Eckhart building Sea Cave 



**Cost**:
Free! Due to the very generous sponsorship of the SIO Biology Section and the SIO Information Technology Group.

**Daily content**: 

1. Demonstration of uses of RNA analysis in relevant research, and group discussion on experimental design.
1. Hands-on workshop with current software to provide entry to typical analysis workflows. The first day will include a short intro/refresher on working from the command line.

**Our Instructors**:

* Lisa Komoroske - UMass Amherst / NOAA
* Tessa Pierce - UC Davis
* Lisa Cohen - UC Davis
* John McCrow- JCVI
* Luke Thompson- NOAA

**Participant experience level**:
The workshop is ideal for graduate students and researchers of all levels considering or at beginning stages of RNAseq studies. More advanced users are also very welcome to attend, as all can benefit from productive discussion, and potentially form good collaborations. In-depth experience with the command line is not necessary, but participants with little or no experience should complete this online tutorial beforehand.

**Data for the workshop**:
The hands-on materials will focus on data generated on the Illumina sequencing platform, and test data will be provided.

**What to bring**: 
A laptop with a working terminal emulator (contact us for help).
