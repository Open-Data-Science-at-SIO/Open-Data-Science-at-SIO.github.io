Dear all,

**Thank you SIO-BUG and R-Users!**

A big thank you to the community, we had a very nice time celebrating summer last night, and all that we've done together in the past few years. Yesterday's party, and the sticker schwag are all kindly provided by funding from The Scripps Genome Center and SIO_students/GSA.

[**SIO-BUG summary review!**](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/BUG-Resources/blob/master/Administrative/SIO-BUG_Review_2017.pdf)

The SIO Bioinformatic's Users Group wrapped up its second year of existence, check out the review for a look at the various different past events, as well as plans for the future. Hopefully this stimulates some feedback and suggestions from you, which we invite you to contact any of us to discuss.


And with this, we wish you an excellent and productive summer!


Jessica and Hao
