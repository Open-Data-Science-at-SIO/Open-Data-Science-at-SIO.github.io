Hi SIO-BUG members,

We are planning to address our community's desire for enlightened (and inspired) transcriptomics use by hosting two events in the coming spring and fall.

Part I on **May 4th from 12-3pm in Hubbs 4500**, will be an extended spring meeting, lead by John McCrow (JCVI, microbial and environmental genomics).  Lisa Komoroske (NOAA, ecophysiology and genomics of aquatic animals) will also be in attendance.  Please [RSVP here](https://goo.gl/forms/xz5BI1NLVyylqf753) if you are interested (there is a maybe option).

John will present an introduction to transcriptomics covering how & why of using transcriptomics as a tool - showing examples of the breadth and depth of its applications, and covering the all-important considerations about designing RNA-Seq experiments, addressing caveats and current challenges.

We will also have a discussion with anyone present (all levels- students, postocs, staff, and PIs- welcome!) about what their interests/plans are, where folks are at in the process, and individual and community needs.

This "Part 1" will guide our design of a later "Part 2" - a 2 day hands-on workshop to be held in late summer/early fall.  If you are interested in the Part 2 workshop, please fill out this [link here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSev7Jna5dCWGnjXvHAiHzxe9bDfrGN1R41cgBli4LrNGf7goQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Sincerely,
Sara R. Rivera
