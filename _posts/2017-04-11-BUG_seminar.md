Hello SIO-BUG Community,

Itâ€™s time for our monthly seminar!

Please join us next **Monday, April 17th at 12 PM** when we will hear from **Dr. Jeff Bowman** who will be sharing with us on  **"OTU-free community structure, metabolic inference, and meta-'omic analysis with paprica"**.

We will be in **Hubbs Hall 4500** with **coffee** so bring a mug and your lunch if you wish and enjoy the Monday lunch hour with us.

Also keep in mind our final seminar of the quarter will be May 8th with Dr. Amro Hamdoun.

Hope to see many of you next week!

Best,
Tiago and Lauren
