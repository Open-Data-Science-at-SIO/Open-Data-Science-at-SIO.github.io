**SIO-BUG 2016-17 Logo competition**

We are turning 1 this year!  Time for SIO-BUG to get a logo.  

For those interested in putting up a design for this year's logo, you can find our mission statement [here](https://github.com/SIO-BUG/BUG-Resources/wiki). and you can send your designs in any reasonable format to [jmblanton@ucsd.edu](mailto:jmblanton@ucsd.edu) **by October 25**. If selected, we can work on an image of appropriate quality.  A monochrome design is ideal. 

Unlimited submissions, from you or anyone you know.  Of course the winner will get a free tee shirt, and FYI we don't roll with that heavyweight cotton nonsense.
