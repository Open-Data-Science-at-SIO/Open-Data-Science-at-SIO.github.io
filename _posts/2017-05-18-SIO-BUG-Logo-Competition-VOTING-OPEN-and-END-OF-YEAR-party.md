Your friendly SIO-BUG and Open Data Science organizers would like to invite your input and give you a heads up about a few final social events to wrap up the year in style. 
 
**1. Logo competition**

[Vote Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJWVFU_vP3oRUVumyShresUiQdXG_y2rrStCliku1KH9KhYw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

It is still the 2016-2017 academic year, so TECHNICALLY, we are still selecting a logo for this year...rest assured it will appear everywhere next year!
Voting will run through Friday, May 26 (it's just a few clicks, so why not do it now?):


**2. End of year party Save-The-Date**

As a heads up, plans are underway for an end of year party, tentatively scheduled for the evening of Wednesday, June 14. (details forthcoming, but there will be food, drink, and stickers - we're still working on figuring out T-shirt pricing.)  This will be a nice meeting of all members of the SIO-BUG, Open Data Science and R-User members, and we hope to see you, your friends and your families (scientific or other).
