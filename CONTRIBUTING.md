# Guidelines for Contributing

Thanks for checking out our organization. Please see below for some general info on how to contribute.

## Access Privileges

All the Open Data Science repos are under the umbrella GitHub organization "Open-Data-Science-at-SIO". The `Teams` interface grants access to the various repos for various groups:
https://github.com/orgs/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/teams

In general, members of the organization have the ability to create new repositories.
Default permissions:
* **admins** of a repo have full read/write/delete access.
* **members** of the organization have read access to **public** and **private** repos.
* **owners** of the organization have the ability to manage teams.
* **team** members can be given fine-grained access to repos. For example, there is a `website-admin` team with admin access to the website repo (this one).

## File Layout




## Website Updates

The website automatically updates on new commits. So in general, nothing needs to be done to keep it up to date, once events and posts are added to the repo. However, the calendar function for upcoming events is not encoded as javascript, so will only "roll over" on a new commit.
